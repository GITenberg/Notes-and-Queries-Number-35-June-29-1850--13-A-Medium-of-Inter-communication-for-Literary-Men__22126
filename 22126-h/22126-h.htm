<h3>GEORGE GORING, EARL OF NORWICH, AND HIS SON
GEORGE, LORD GORING.</h3>

  <p>G.'s inquiry (Vol. i., p. 22.) about the two Gorings of the Civil
  War&mdash;a period of our history in which I am much interested&mdash;has
  led me to look into some of the sources of original information for that
  time, in the hope that I might be enabled to answer his Queries. I regret
  I cannot yet answer his precise questions, when Lord Goring the son was
  married, and when and where he died? but I think the following references
  to notices of the father and the son will be acceptable to him; and I
  venture to think that the working out in this way of neglected
  biographies, is one of the many uses to which your excellent periodical
  may be applied.</p>

  <p>Confusion has undoubtedly been made between the father and son by
  careless compilers. But whoever carefully reads the passages of
  contemporary writers relating to the two Gorings, and keeps in mind that
  the title of Earl of Norwich, given by Charles I. in November, 1644, to
  the father, was not recognised by the parliamentary party, will have no
  difficulty in distinguishing between the two. Thus it will be seen in two
  of the passages which I subjoin from Carte's <i>Letters</i>, that in 1649
  a parliamentarian calls the father Lord Goring, and Sir Edward Nicholas
  calls him Earl of Norwich.</p>

  <p>Burke, in his <i>Dormant and Extinct Peerages</i>, vol. iii., makes
  the mistake of giving to the father the son's proceedings at Portsmouth
  at the beginning of the Civil War.</p>

  <p>Lord Goring the son, then Colonel Goring, commanding a regiment in the
  Low Countries, was, at the siege of Breda, September, 1637, severely
  wounded in the leg, and had a narrow escape of losing it. Sir William
  Boswell, the English ambassador at the Hague, writes to Bramhall, then
  Bishop of Derry, and afterwards Archbishop of Armagh:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Colonel Goring having the guard of the English in the approaches, was
  shot so dangerously cross the shin of his leg, a little above his ankle,
  as the chirurgion at first resolved to cut off his leg to save his life;
  but upon second thoughts, and some opposition by one of them against
  four, they forebare; and now, thanks be to God, he is gotten out of
  danger of losing life or leg this bout: his excellent merits caused a
  great sorrow at his misfortune, and now as great comfort in the hope of
  his recovery"&mdash;(<i>Rawdon Papers</i>, p. 39.)</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>That the son was already married to Lady Letitia Boyle at Christmas,
  1641, appears from a letter of the Earl of Cork, the lady's father, to
  the Earl of Norwich (at that time Lord Goring), in Lord Orrery's <i>State
  Letters</i> (vol. i. p. 5. Dublin edition):&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I have scarce time to present my service to you and your lady, and to
  George and my poor Letitia, whom God bless."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In Carte's <i>Collection of Letters</i> (vol. i. p. 359.) <!-- Page 66
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page66"></a>{66}</span>is a letter from
  Lord Byron, dated "Beauvois, March 1-11, 1650," to the Marquis of Ormond,
  stating that Lord Goring the son has come to Beauvois, and is on his way
  to Spain, about the settlement of a pension which had been promised him
  there, and also to endeavour to get arms and money for the King's service
  in Ireland; and that, having settled his business in Spain, he desires
  nothing better than to serve as a volunteer under Ormond for King
  Charles. Lord Byron strongly recommends Ormond to avail himself of
  Goring's services:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I am confident my Lord Goring may be serviceable to your Excellence
  in many respects, and therefore have rather encouraged him in this his
  resolution, than any ways dehorted him from it; and especially because he
  is to pass by the Spanish Court, where he hath such habitudes, by reason
  of the service both his father and he hath done that crown."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In an intercepted letter of a parliamentarian, dated Jan. 8, 1649,
  which is in Carte's <i>Letters</i> (vol. i. p. 201.), is the following
  mention of the Earl of Norwich, then under sentence of death by the High
  Court of Justice:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Our great minds say, Thursday the King shall die, and two or three
  great Lords with him, Capel and Loughborough being two of them. Goring
  hath gotten Ireton to friend, who excuses him yet."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Sir E. Nicholas writes, April 8, 1649, to the Marquis of Ormond, that
  the Earl of Norwich (as he styles him) has been reprieved at the suit of
  the Spanish and Dutch ambassadors. (Carte's <i>Letters</i>, vol. i. p.
  247.)</p>

  <p>In the following passage of a speech, in the discussions about the
  House of Lords in Richard Cromwell's Parliament, there is no doubt that
  the Earl of Norwich is referred to as Lord Goring: and I should infer
  that George Lord Goring the son was then dead, as he had unquestionably
  done more than enough to forfeit his privileges in the view of
  Commonwealth men:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"What hath the son of Lord Goring or Lord Capel done to forfeit their
  right?"&mdash;(Burton's <i>Diary</i>, iii. 421. Feb. 22. 1659.)</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>George Lord Goring the son is referred to in another speech preserved
  in Burton's <i>Diary</i>, and is there called "young Lord Goring." (iii.
  206.)</p>

  <p>Pepys mentions the return of "Lord Goring" from France, April 11, 1660
  (vol. i. p. 54.). Lord Braybrooke's note says that this was "Charles, who
  succeeded his father as second Earl of Norwich." Is it certain that this
  was not the old Earl of Norwich himself?</p>

  <p>The death of the old Earl of Norwich is thus chronicled in Peck's
  <i>Desiderata Curiosa</i>, p. 542.:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Jan. 6. 1662-3, died Lord Goring on his passage by land from Hampton
  Court to London, at Brainford, about eighty years of age: he was Earl of
  Norwich."</p>

<h3>MSS. OF BISHOP RIDLEY: A "NOTE" AND A
"QUERY."</h3>

  <p>A "Note" in the <i>Original Letters</i> relative to the English
  Reformation, published by the Parker Society, p. 91., mentions the
  existence of an important MS. treatise by Bishop Ridley, which had been
  unknown when the works of that prelate were collected and published by
  the Parker Society in 1841. It seems to be desirable that the fact should
  be placed on record in your most useful publication: the "Note" is as
  follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A copy of Bishop Ridley's 'Conference by writing with M. Hoper,
  exhibited up to the council in the time of King Edward the Sixth,' was in
  the possession of Archbishop Whitgift: see his <i>Defence of the Answer
  to the Admonition</i>, <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 1574, p. 25. But
  its existence was unknown (see <i>Ridley's Life of Bishop Ridley</i>,
  Lond. 1763, p. 315.) in later years, till a copy, slightly imperfect, was
  discovered in 1844, in the extensive collection of MSS. belonging to Sir
  Thomas Phillips, Bart."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>There is another MS. treatise by Bishop Ridley, that has been missing
  for nearly three centuries, respecting which I should be glad to offer a
  "Query:" I allude to Ridley's <i>Treatise on Election and
  Predestination</i>. The evidence that such a piece ever existed is, that
  Ridley, in answer both to a communication from prison, signed by Bishop
  Ferrar, Rowland Taylor, John Bradford, and Archdeacon Philpot, and
  probably to other letters from Bradford, wrote,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Where you say that, if your request had been heard, things, you
  think, had been in better case than they be, know you that, concerning
  the matter you mean, I have in Latin drawn out the places of the
  Scriptures, and upon the same have noted what I can for the time. Sir, in
  those matters I am so fearful, that I dare not speak further, yea, almost
  none otherwise, than the very text doth, as it were, lead me by the
  hand."&mdash;<i>Works of Bishop Ridley</i>, Parker Soc., p. 368.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And to this statement Bishop Coverdale, in the <i>Letters of the
  Martyrs</i>, Day, 1564, p. 65., caused the following side-note to be
  printed:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"He meaneth here the matter of God's election, whereof he afterward
  wrote a godly and comfortable treatise, remaining yet in the hands of
  some, and hereafter shall come to light, if God so will."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Glocester Ridley, in his <i>Life of Bishop Ridley</i>, 1763, p. 554,
  states:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I never heard that it was published, nor have I been able to meet
  with it in MS. The great learning and cool judgment of this prelate, and
  the entire subjection of his imagination to the revealed will of God,
  make the loss of this treatise much to be lamented."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Could any of your correspondents offer any suggestion, or supply any
  information, which might throw light on the subject, or might give a clue
  to the lost manuscript? The treatise referred to <!-- Page 67 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page67"></a>{67}</span>might possibly still
  exist, and, even if without Ridley's name, or in an imperfect state,
  might yet be identified, either from the handwriting or some other
  circumstance. Do any of your correspondents possess or know of any MS. on
  Election or Free-will, of the time of the Reformation, which might
  possibly be the missing treatise? Things turn up so curiously, in
  quarters where one would least expect it, and sometimes after more than
  three centuries, that one would willingly hope that this lost treatise
  might even yet be found or identified.</p>

<h3>FOLK LORE.</h3>

  <p><i>Legend of Sir Richard Baker, surnamed Bloody Baker</i>.&mdash;I one
  day was looking over the different monuments in Cranbrook Church in Kent,
  when in the chancel my attention was arrested by one erected to the
  memory of Sir Richard Baker. The gauntlet, gloves, helmet, and spurs were
  (as is often the case in monumental erections of Elizabethan date)
  suspended over the tomb. What chiefly attracted my attention was the
  colour of the gloves, which was red. The old woman who acted as my
  cicerone, seeing me look at them, said, "Aye, miss, those are Bloody
  Baker's gloves; their red colour comes from the blood he shed." This
  speech awakened my curiosity to hear more, and with very little pressing
  I induced my old guide to tell me the following strange tale.</p>

  <p>The Baker family had formerly large possessions in Cranbrook, but in
  the reign of Edward VI. great misfortunes fell on them; by extravagance
  and dissipation, they gradually lost all their lands, until an old house
  in the village (now used as the poor-house) was all that remained to
  them. The sole representative of the family remaining at the accession of
  Queen Mary, was Sir Richard Baker. He had spent some years abroad in
  consequence of a duel; but when, said my informant, Bloody Queen Mary
  reigned, he thought he might safely return, as he was a Papist. When he
  came to Cranbrook he took up his abode in his old house; he only brought
  one foreign servant with him, and these two lived alone. Very soon
  strange stories began to be whispered respecting unearthly shrieks having
  been heard frequently to issue at nightfall from his house. Many people
  of importance were stopped and robbed in the Glastonbury woods, and many
  unfortunate travellers were missed and never heard of more. Richard Baker
  still continued to live in seclusion, but he gradually repurchased his
  alienated property, although he was known to have spent all he possessed
  before he left England. But wickedness was not always to prosper. He
  formed an apparent attachment to a young lady in the neighbourhood,
  remarkable for always wearing a great many jewels. He often pressed her
  to come and see his old house, telling her he had many curious things he
  wished to show her. She had always resisted fixing a day for her visit,
  but happening to walk within a short distance of his house, she
  determined to surprise him with a visit; her companion, a lady older than
  herself, endeavoured to dissuade her from doing so, but she would not be
  turned from her purpose. They <!-- Page 68 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page68"></a>{68}</span>knocked at the door, but no one answered
  them; they, however, discovered it was not locked, and determined to
  enter. At the head of the stairs hung a parrot, which on their passing
  cried out,&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Peepoh, pretty lady, be not too bold,</p>
      <p>Or your red blood will soon run cold."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>And cold did run the blood of the adventurous damsel when, on opening
  one of the room doors, she found it filled with the dead bodies of
  murdered persons, chiefly women. Just then they heard a noise, and on
  looking out of the window saw Bloody Baker and his servant bringing in
  the murdered body of a lady. Nearly dead with fear, they concealed
  themselves in a recess under the staircase.</p>

  <p>As the murderers with their dead burden passed by them, the hand of
  the unfortunate murdered lady hung in the baluster of the stairs; with an
  oath Bloody Baker chopped it off, and it fell into the lap of one of the
  concealed ladies. As soon as the murderers had passed by, the ladies ran
  away, having the presence of mind to carry with them the dead hand, on
  one of the fingers of which was a ring. On reaching home they told their
  story, and in confirmation of it displayed the ring. All the families who
  had lost relatives mysteriously were then told of what had been found
  out; and they determined to ask Baker to a large party, apparently in a
  friendly manner, but to have constables concealed ready to take him into
  custody. He came, suspecting nothing, and then the lady told him all she
  had seen, pretending it was a dream. "Fair lady," said he, "dreams are
  nothing: they are but fables." "They may be fables," said she; "but is
  this a fable?" and she produced the hand and ring. Upon this the
  constables rushed in and took him; and the tradition further says, he was
  burnt, notwithstanding Queen Mary tried to save him, on account of the
  religion he professed.</p>

  <p><i>Cure for Warts.</i>&mdash;Steal a piece of meat from a butcher's
  stall or his basket, and after having well rubbed the parts affected with
  the stolen morsel, bury it under a gateway, at a four lane ends, or, in
  case of emergency, in any secluded place. All this must be done so
  secretly as to escape detection: and as the portion of meat decays the
  warts will disappear. This practice is very prevalent in Lancashire and
  some parts of Yorkshire; and two of my female acquaintances having
  <i>tried</i> the remedy, stoutly maintain its efficacy.</p>

  neighbourhood of Manchester:&mdash;Take a piece of twine, making upon it
  as many knots as there are warts to be removed; touch each wart with the
  corresponding knot; and bury the twine in a moist place, saying at the
  same time, "There is none to redeem it besides thee." As the process of
  decay goes on, the warts gradually disappear.</p>

  <p><i>Charm for the Cure of the King's Evil.</i>&mdash;Acting on the
  advice of your able correspondent <span class="sc">Emdee</span> (Vol. i.,
  p. 429.), I beg to forward the following curious and cruel charm for the
  cure of the king's evil, extracted from a very quaint old work by William
  Ellis, farmer of Little Gaddesden, near Hempstead, Herts, published at
  Salisbury in 1750:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A girl at Gaddesden, having the evil in her Feet from her Infancy, at
  eleven years old lost one of her toes by it, and was so bad that she
  could hardly walk, therefore was to be sent to a London Hospital in a
  little time. But a Beggar woman coming to the Door and hearing of it,
  said, that if they would cut off the hind leg, and the fore leg on the
  contrary side of that, of a toad, and she wear them in a silken bag about
  her neck, it would certainly cure her; but it was to be observed, that on
  the toad's losing its legs, it was to be turned loose abroad, and as it
  pined, wasted, and died, the distemper would likewise waste and die;
  which happened accordingly, for the girl was entirely cured by it, never
  having had the evil afterwards. Another Gaddesden girl having the evil in
  her eyes, her parents dried a toad in the sun, and put it in a silken
  bag, which they hung on the back part of her neck; and although it was
  thus dried, it drawed so much as to raise little blisters, but did the
  girl a great deal of service, till she carelessly lost it."</p>

  <p><i>Fig-Sunday.</i>&mdash;One of my Sunday-school boys, in reply to my
  question "What particular name was there for the Sunday before Easter?"
  answered "Fig-Sunday."</p>

  <p>Can you give any authentic information as to the origin of this name?
  It most probably alludes to our Saviour's desire to eat fruit of the
  fig-tree on his way from Bethany on the <i>Monday</i> following.</p>

  <p>Hone mentions that at a village in Hertfordshire, more figs are sold
  in that week than at any other period of the year; but assigns no reason
  for the custom. If you have met with any satisfactory explanation of this
  name, I shall feel obliged by your making it public.</p>

<h3>NOTE ON A PASSAGE IN HUDIBRAS.</h3>

  <p>Butler, in his description of Hudibras, says (Part <span
  class="scac">I.</span> c. i. line 453.) that the knight</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i4hg3">"&mdash;&mdash;wore but one Spur,</p>
      <p>As wisely knowing, cou'd he stir</p>
      <p>To active Foot one side of 's Horse,</p>
      <p>The other wou'd not hang an A&mdash;&mdash;."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Gray, the most copious annotator on the poem, passes these lines in
  silence; and it is probable, therefore, that the description is taken by
  readers <!-- Page 69 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page69"></a>{69}</span>in general as an original sketch. I find,
  however, in a volume entitled <i>Gratiæ Ludentes: Jests from the
  Universitie</i>, by H. L., Oxen. [sic], London, 1638, the following,
  which may have been in Butler's mind:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"<i>One that wore but one Spurre.</i></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>"A scholler being jeer'd on the way for wearing but one Spurre, said,
  that if one side of his horse went on, it was not likely that the other
  would stay behinde."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>As compilers of jest-books do nothing but copy from their
  predecessors, it is likely that this joke may be found elsewhere, though
  I have not met with it in any other collection. At all events, the date
  of the vol. from which I quote is in favour of Butler's intimacy with its
  contents; and as it is interesting, even in so trivial a matter, to trace
  the resources of our popular authors, you may perhaps think it worth
  while to include the above in a number of the "<span

<h3>COFFEE, BLACK BROTH.</h3>

  <p>The idea has been suggested in the "<span class="sc">Notes and
  Queries</span>," but I do not know how to refer to the places<a
  name="footnotetag3" href="#footnote3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>, or recollect
  what authorities were given. Probably that of Howell was not, as it
  occurs in a very scarce volume; and, on the chance of its not having been
  met with by your readers, I send it. It is contained in a letter
  addressed "To his highly esteemed Friend and Compatriot, Judge Rumsey,
  upon his <i>Provang</i>, or rare pectorall Instrument, and his rare
  experiments of Cophie and Tobacco." This letter is prefixed to the
  learned Judge's <i>Organon Salutis: an Instrument to cleanse the Stomach,
  as also divers New Experiments of the Virtue of Tobacco and Coffee,
  &amp;c.</i> London, 1657, 8vo.</p>

  <p>Howell says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Touching coffee, I concurre with them in opinion, who hold it to be
  that black-broth which was us'd of old in Lacedemon, whereof the Poets
  sing; Surely it must needs be salutiferous, because so many sagacious,
  and the wittiest sort of Nations use it so much; as they who have
  conversed with Shashes and Turbants doe well know. But, besides the
  exsiccant quality it hath to dry up the crudities of the Stomach, as also
  to comfort the Brain, to fortifie the sight with its steem, and prevent
  Dropsies, Gouts, the Scurvie, together with the Spleen and
  Hypocondriacall windes (all which it doth without any violence or
  distemper at all), I say, besides all these qualities, 'tis found
  already, that this Coffee-drink hath caused a greater sobriety among the
  nations: For whereas formerly Apprentices and Clerks with others, used to
  take their mornings' draught in Ale, Beer, or Wine, which by the
  dizziness they cause in the Brain, make many unfit for businesse, they
  use now to play the Good-fellows in this wakefull and civill drink:
  Therefore that worthy Gentleman, Mr. Mudiford, who introduced the
  practice hereof first to London, deserves much respect of the whole
  Nation."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Of Judge Rumsey and his <i>Provang</i> (which was a flexible whalebone
  from two to three feet long, with a small linen or silk button at the
  end, which was to be introduced into the stomach to produce the effect of
  an emetic), the reader may find some account in Wood's <i>Athen</i>.
  (Bliss's edit., vol. iii. p. 509.), and this is not the place to speak of
  them except as they had to do with coffee; on that point a few more words
  may be allowed.</p>

  <p>Besides the letter of Howell already quoted, two others are prefixed
  to the book; one from the author to Sir Henry Blount, the other Sir
  Henry's reply. In the former the Judge says,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I lately understood that your discovery, in your excellent book of
  travels, hath brought the use of the Turkes Physick, of Cophie, in great
  request in England, whereof I have made use, in another form than is used
  by boyling of it in Turkie, and being less loathsome and troublesome,"
  &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And Sir Henry, after a fervent panegyric on coffee,
  replies:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"As for your way of taking both Cophie and Tobacco, the rarity of the
  invention consists in leaving the old way: For the water of the one and
  the smoke of the other may be of inconvenience to many; but your way in
  both takes in the virtue of the Simples without any additionall
  mischief."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>As this may excite the reader's curiosity to know what was the Judge's
  new and superior "way" of using coffee, I will add his prescription for
  making "electuary of cophy," which is, I believe, the only preparation of
  it which he used or recommended:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Take equall quantity of Butter and Sallet-oyle, melt them well
  together, but not boyle them: Then stirre them well that they may
  incorporate together: Then melt therewith three times as much Honey, and
  stirre it well together: Then add thereunto Powder of Turkish Cophie, to
  make it a thick Electuary." p. 5.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>A very little consideration may convince one that this electuary was
  likely to effect the purpose for which it was recommended.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Whether," says the Judge, "it be in time of health or sickness,
  whensoever you find any evill disposition in the stomach, eat a
  convenient meal of what meat and drink you please, then walk a little
  while after it: Then set down your body bending, and thrust the said
  Whalebone Instrument into your stomach, stirring it very gently, which
  will make you vomit; then drink a good draught of drink, and so use the
  Instrument as oft as you please, but never doe this upon an empty
  stomach. To make the stomach more apt to vomit, and to prepare the
  humours thereunto before you eat and drink, Take the bigness of a Nutmeg
  or more of the said Electuary of Cophie, &amp;c., into your mouth; <!--
  Page 70 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page70"></a>{70}</span>then
  take drink to drive it down; then eat and drink, and walk, and use the
  Instrument as before." p. 19.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Should any reader wish to test the efficacy of the learned Judge's
  prescription, I am afraid he must make an "instrument" for himself, or
  get one made for him; though when the <i>Organon Salutis</i> was
  published, they were "commonly sold in London, and especially at the long
  shops in Westminster Hall."</p>

  <p>As to the book, and the name of the author, I may add (with reference
  to Wood's <i>Athen.</i>), that in the copy before me, which is, like that
  referred to by Dr. Bliss, of the first edition (not the second mentioned
  by Aubrey as published in 1659), the author's name does not appear on the
  <i>title-page</i> at all. There we find only "By W. R. of Gray's Inne,
  Esq. Experto credo" [sic]; and really one seems as if one could believe
  any thing from a man who had habitually used such medicines, for I have
  said nothing of his infusion of tobacco, for which you must&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Take a quarter of a pound of Tobacco, and a quart of Ale, White-wine,
  or Sider, and three or four spoonfulls of Hony, and two pennyworth of
  Mace; And infuse these by a soft fire, in a close earthen pot, to the
  consumption of almost the one-half, and then you may take from two
  spoonfulls to twelve [no tea-spoons in those days], and drink it in a cup
  with Ale or Beer."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>One could, I say, believe almost any thing from a gentleman who under
  such a course of discipline was approaching the age of fourscore; but
  though the title-page has only his initials, the Dedication to the
  Marquess of Dorchester, and the letter to Sir Henry Blount, are both
  signed "Will. Rumsey."</p>

<h2>Queries.</h2>

<h3>QUERIES CONCERNING OLD MSS.</h3>

  <p>I am very desirous of gaining some knowledge respecting the following
  MSS., especially as regards their locality at the present time. Perhaps
  some of your numerous readers can help me to the information which I
  seek.</p>

  <p>1. "Whitelocke's Labours remembered in the Annales of his Life,
  written for the use of his Children." This valuable MS. contains a most
  minute and curious account of the performance of Shirley's masque,
  entitled <i>The Triumphs of Peace</i>. In 1789, when Dr. Burney published
  the third volume of his <i>History of Music</i>, it was in the possession
  of Dr. Morton of the British Museum.&mdash;Query, Was Dr. Morton's
  library disposed of by auction, or what was its destiny?</p>

  <p>2. "A MS. Treatise on the Art of Illumination, written in the year
  1525." This MS. is said by Edward Rowe Mores, in his <i>Dissertation upon
  English Typographical Founders</i>, to have been in the possession of
  Humphrey Wanley, who by its help "refreshed the injured or decayed
  illuminations in the library of the Earl of Oxford." The MS. was
  transcribed by Miss Elstob in 1710, and a copy of her transcript was in
  the possession of Mr. George Ballard. Where now is the original?</p>

  <p>3. "A Memorandum-book in the handwriting of Paul Bowes, Esq., son of
  Sir Thomas Bowes, of London, and of Bromley Hall, Essex, Knight, and
  dated 1673." In 1783 this MS., which contains some highly interesting and
  important information, was in the possession of a gentleman named Broke,
  of Nacton in Suffolk, a descendant from the Bowes family; but I have not
  been able to trace it further.</p>

  <p>4. "The Negotiations of Thomas Wolsey, Cardinall." This valuable MS.
  was in the collection of Dr. Farmer, who wrote on the
  fly-leaf,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I believe several of the Letters and State Papers in this volume have
  not been published; three or four are printed in the collections at the
  end of Dr. Fiddes' <i>Life of Wolsey</i>, from a MS. in the Yelverton
  Library."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>If I remember rightly, the late Richard Heber afterwards came into the
  possession of this curious and important volume. It is lamentable to
  think of the dispersion of poor Heber's manuscripts.</p>

  merit of having designed and executed this celebrated monument, Mr. Peter
  Cunningham says (<i>Literary Gazette</i>, June 5.),&mdash;"The merit of
  the composition belongs to Chantrey and Stothard." As a regular reader of
  the "<span class="sc">Notes and Queries</span>," I shall feel obliged to
  Mr. Cunningham (whose name I am always glad to see as a correspondent) if
  he will be kind enough to inform me on what evidence he founds the title
  of Mr. Stothard to a share of the merit of a piece of sculpture, which is
  so generally attributed to the genius of Chantrey?</p>

  <p><i>Viscount Dundee's Ring.</i>&mdash;In the <i>Letters of John Grahame
  of Claverhouse, Viscount of Dundee</i>, printed for the Bannatyne Club in
  1826, is a description and engraving of a ring containing some of Ld.
  Dundee's hair, with the letters V.D., surmounted by a coronet, worked on
  it in gold; and on the inside of the ring are engraved a skull, and the

  <p><i>The Kilkenny Cats.</i>&mdash;I would feel obliged if any of your
  correspondents could give me information as to the first, or any early,
  published allusion to the strange tale, modernly become proverbial, of
  the ferocity of the cats of Kilkenny. The story generally told is, that
  two of those animals fought in a sawpit with such ferocious determination
  that when the battle was over nothing could be found remaining of either
  combatant except <i>his tail</i>,&mdash;the marvellous inference to be
  drawn therefrom being, of course, that they had devoured each other. This
  ludicrous anecdote has, no doubt, been generally looked upon as an
  absurdity of the Joe Miller class; but this I conceive to be a mistake. I
  have not the least doubt that the story of the mutual destruction of the
  contending cats was an allegory designed to typify the utter ruin to
  which centuries of litigation and embroilment on the subject of
  conflicting rights and privileges tended to reduce the respective
  exchequers of the rival municipal bodies of Kilkenny and
  Irishtown,&mdash;separate corporations existing within the liberties of
  one city, and the boundaries of whose respective jurisdiction had never
  been marked out or defined by an authority to which either was willing to
  bow. Their struggles for precedency, and for the maintenance of alleged
  rights invaded, commenced <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 1377. (see
  <i>Rot. Claus.</i> 51 Ed. III. 76.), and were carried on with truly
  feline fierceness and implacability till the end of the seventeenth
  century, when it may fairly be considered that they had mutually devoured
  each other to the very <i>tail</i>, as we find their property all
  mortgaged, and see them each passing by-laws that their respective
  officers should be content with the dignity of their station, and forego
  all hope of salary till the suit at law with the other "pretended
  corporation" should be terminated, and the incumbrances thereby caused
  removed with the vanquishment of the enemy. Those who have taken the
  story of the Kilkenny cats in its literal sense have done grievous
  injustice to the character of the grimalkins of the "faire cittie," who
  are really quite as demure and quietly disposed a race of tabbies as it
  is in the nature of any such animals to be.</p>

<h2>Replies.</h2>

<h3>SIR GEORGE BUC.</h3>

  <p>It has often been noticed, that when a writer wishes to support some
  favourite hypothesis, he quite overlooks many important particulars that
  militate against his own view of the case. The Rev. Mr. Corser, in his
  valuable communication respecting Sir George Buc (Vol. ii., p. 38.), is
  not exempt from this accusation. He has omitted the statement of Malone,
  that "Sir George Buc died on the 28th of September, 1623." (Boswell's
  <i>Shakspeare</i>, iii. 59.) We know <i>positively</i> that in May 1622,
  Sir George, "by reason of sickness and indisposition of body, wherewith
  it hath pleased God to visit him, was become disabled and insufficient to
  undergo and perform" the duties of Master of the Revels; and it is
  equally <i>positive</i> that Malone would not so circumstantially have
  said, "Sir George Buc <i>died</i> on the 28th of September, 1623,"
  without some good authority for so doing. It is only to be regretted that
  the learned commentator neglected to give that authority.</p>

  <p>Mr. Corser wishes to show that Sir George Buc's days "were further
  prolonged till 1660;" but I think he is in error as to his conclusions,
  and that <i>another</i> George Buc must enter the field and divide the
  honours with his knightly namesake.</p>

  <p>It is perfectly clear that a George Buc was living long after the date
  assigned as that of the death of Sir George, by Malone. This George
  <i>Buck</i>, for so he invariably spells his name, contributed a copy of
  verses to Yorke's <i>Union of Honour</i>, 1640; to Shirley's
  <i>Poems</i>, 1646; and to the folio edition of Beaumont and Fletcher's
  <i>Plays</i>, 1647. Ritson, then, when speaking of Sir George Buc's
  <i>Great Plantagenet</i>, as published in 1635, was rather hasty in
  pronouncing it as the work of "some fellow who assumed his name," because
  here is evidence that a person of the same name (if not Sir George
  himself, as Mr. Corser thinks) was living at the period. The name, if
  <i>assumed</i> in the case of the <i>Great Plantagenet</i>, would hardly
  have been kept up in the publications just alluded to.</p>

  <p>In the British Museum, among the Cotton MSS. (<i>Tiberius</i>, E.&nbsp;X.),
  is preserved a MS. called "The history of King Richard the Third,
  comprised in five books, gathered and written by Sir G. Buc, Knight,
  Master of the King's Office of the Revels, and one of the gentlemen of
  his Majesty's Privy Chamber." This MS., which appears to have been the
  author's rough draft, is corrected by interlineations and erasements in
  every page. It is much injured by fire, but a part of the dedication to
  Sir Thomas Howard, the Earl of Arundel, &amp;c., still remains, together
  with "an advertisement to the reader," which is dated "from the King's
  Office of the Revels, St. Peter's Hill, 1619." This <i>history</i> was
  first published in 1646, by George Buck, <i>Esquire</i>, who says, in his
  dedication to Philip, the Earl of Pembroke and Montgomery, "that he had
  <i>collected these papers out of their dust</i>." Here is evidence that
  the work was not <i>published</i> by the original compiler; besides, how
  can Mr. Corser reconcile his author's knighthood with the designations on
  the respective title-pages of <i>The Great Plantagenet</i>, and <i>The
  History of Richard the Third</i>? In the former the writer is styled
  "George Buck, <i>Esquire</i>," and in the latter, "George Buck,
  <i>Gentleman</i>." It is difficult to account for Mr. Corser's omission
  of these facts, because I am well assured, that, with his extensive
  knowledge of our earlier poets, my information is not new to him.</p>

  <p>That there were <i>two</i> George Bucs in the seventeenth century, and
  both of them poets, cannot, I think, be doubted. Perhaps they were not
  even relations; at any rate, Mr. Corser's account of the parentage of
  <i>one</i> differs from mine entirely.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"He [Sir George Buc] was born at Ely, the eldest son of Robert Bucke,
  and Elizabeth, the daughter of Peter Lee of Brandon Ferry; the grandson
  of Robert Bucke, and Jane, the daughter of Clement Higham; the
  great-grandson of Sir John Bucke, who, having helped Richard to a horse
  on Bosworth Field, was attainted for his zeal."&mdash;Chalmers'
  <i>Apology</i>, p. 488.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The MS. now in Mr. Corser's possession occurs in the <i>Bibliotheca
  Heberiana</i>, Part xi. No. 98., and I observe, by referring to that
  volume, that the compiler has the following note:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"This MS. is entirely in the handwriting of Sir George Buck, Master of
  the Revels in the reign of James I., as prepared by him for publication.
  The initials G.&nbsp;B. correspond with those of his name, and the handwriting
  is similar to a MS. Dedication of his poem to Lord Chancellor Egerton,
  which is preserved at Bridgewater House."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The authorship of <i>The Famous History of St. George</i>, then, rests
  solely upon the initials "G.&nbsp;B.," and the similarity of the handwriting
  to that of <!-- Page 74 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page74"></a>{74}</span>Sir George Buc. Now it must be remembered
  that the MS. dedication was written in 1605, and the <i>history</i> after
  1660! Surely an interval of <i>fifty-five</i> years must have made some
  difference in the penmanship of the worthy Master of the Revels. I think
  we must receive the <i>comparison</i> of handwritings with considerable
  caution; and, unless some of your readers can produce "new evidence" in
  favour of one or other of the claimants, I much fear that your reverend
  correspondent will have to exclaim with Master Ford in the
  play,&mdash;</p>

  <p>I am not quite certain that I can satisfactorily answer Mr. Corser's
  query; but at least I am able to show that <i>a</i> Sir George Buck,
  seised in fee of lands in Lincolnshire, did die in or about 1623. In the
  Report Office of the Court of Chancery is a Report made to Lord Keeper
  Williams by Sir Wm. Jones, who had been Lord Chief Justice in Ireland,
  dated the 10th Nov. 1623, respecting a suit referred to him by the Lord
  Keeper, in which <i>Stephen Buck</i> was plaintiff and <i>Robert Buck</i>
  defendant. In this report is contained a copy of the will of Sir George
  Buck, whom I supposed to be <i>the</i> Sir George Buck, the master of the
  Revels; and the will containing a singular clause, disinheriting his
  brother Robert because he was alleged to be a Jesuit, and it having been
  supposed that Sir George Buck died intestate, I published an extract from
  it in my <i>Acta Cancellariæ</i> (Benning, 1847). On further examination
  of the whole of the document in question, I find it distinctly stated,
  and of course that statement was made on evidence adduced, that Sir
  George Buck was seised in fee of certain lands and tenements in Boston
  and Skydbrooke, both of which places, I need scarcely say, are in
  Lincolnshire. It is therefore, at least, not improbable that the testator
  was a native of Lincolnshire. It also appears that the proceedings in
  Chancery were instituted previously to June, 1623; and, inasmuch as Sir
  George Buck's will is recited in those proceedings, he must have died
  before they were commenced, and not in September, 1623, as I once
  supposed. It may, perhaps, aid Mr. Corser's researches to know that the
  will (which is not to be found at Doctors' Commons) mentions, besides the
  brother Robert, a sister, Cecilia Buck, who had a son, Stephen, who had a
  son, George Buck, whom his great uncle, Sir George, made ultimate heir to
  his lands in Lincolnshire.</p>

<h3>"A FROG HE WOULD A-WOOING GO."</h3>

  <p>Your <span class="sc">Sexagenarian</span> who dates from "Shooter's
  Hill," has <i>not</i> hit the mark when he suggests that Anna Bouleyn's
  marriage with Henry VIII. (in the teeth of the Church) is the hidden
  mystery of the popular old song,&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Sir Frog he would a-wooing go,</p>
      <p>Whether his mother was willing or no."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>That some courtship in the history of the British monarchy, leaving a
  deep impression on the public mind, gave rise to this generally diffused
  ballad, is exceedingly probable; but the style and wording of the song
  are evidently of a period much later than the age of Henry VIII. Might
  not the madcap adventure of Prince Charles with Buckingham into Spain, to
  <i>woo the Infanta</i>, be its real origin? "Heigho! for Antony Rowley"
  is the chorus. Now "Old Rowley" was a pet name for Charles the Second, as
  any reader of the Waverley Novels must recollect. No event was more
  likely to be talked about and sung about at the time, the adventurous
  nature of the trip being peculiarly adapted to the ballad-monger.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Francis Mahony.</span></p>

  <p><i>"A Frog he would a-wooing go"</i> (Vol. ii., p. 45.)&mdash;Your
  correspondent T.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;D. is certainly right in his notion that the ballad
  of "A frog he would a-wooing go" is very old, however fanciful may be his
  conjecture about its personal or political application to Henry VIII. and
  Anne Boleyn. That it could not refer to "the Cavaliers and the
  Roundheads," another of T.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;D.'s notions, is clear from the fact, that
  it was entered at Stationers' Hall in November, 1581; as appears by the
  quotation made by Mr. Payne Collier, in his second volume of
  <i>Extracts</i>, printed for the Shakspeare Society last year. It runs
  thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Edward White. Lycensed unto him, &amp;c., theis iiij. ballads
  followinge, that is to saie, A moste strange weddinge of the frogge and
  the mowse," &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Upon this entry Mr. Collier makes this note:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The ballad can hardly be any other than the still well-known comic
  song 'A Frog he would a-wooing go.'"</p>

  <p>It may have been even older than 1581, when Edward White entered it;
  for it is possible that it was then only a reprint of an earlier
  production. I, like Mr. Collier, have heard it sung "in our theatres and
  streets," and, like T. S. D., always fancied that it was ancient.</p>

  <p><i>Rowley Powley.</i>&mdash;As generally inclined to the belief that
  everything is older than anybody knows of, I am rather startled by
  "Rowley Powley" not being as old as myself. I remember seeing mentioned
  somewhere, without any reference to this chorus, that <i>rowley
  powley</i> is a name for a plump fowl, of which both "gammon and spinach"
  are posthumous connexions. I cannot help thinking that this may be a clue
  to some prior occurrence of the chorus, with or without <!-- Page 75
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page75"></a>{75}</span>the song. If
  "derry down," which has been said to be druidical, were judged of by the
  last song it went with, how old would be the Druids?</p>

  <p>"<i>A Frog he would a-wooing go.</i>"&mdash;It may perhaps be
  interesting to some of your correspondents on the subject of "A frog he
  would a-wooing go," to know that there exists an Irish version of that
  woeful tale, which differs in several respects from the ballad which has
  so long been familiar to English ears. The burthen of "Heigho! says
  Rowley," does not occur in the Hibernian composition, but a still less
  intelligible chorus supplies its place. The air is exceedingly quaint,
  and seems to me to bear the stamp of antiquity. The words are as
  follow:&mdash;</p>

<h2>Replies to Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p><i>Carucate of Land</i> (Vol. ii., p. 9.).&mdash;The measure of the
  carucate was as indefinite in Edward III.'s time as at an earlier period.
  It then, as before, represented as much land as could be worked with one
  plough in a year. I am fortunately enabled to give your correspondent
  E.V. a precise answer to his Query. In a MS. survey of the Hospitallers'
  lands in England, taken under the direction of Prior Philip Thame, <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 1338, which I transcribed from the original,
  among the records of the order, I find in the "extent" of the "Camera de
  Hetherington in comitatu Northampton,"&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Item. v Carucate terre continentes v<sup>c</sup> acre terre: pretium
  cujuslibet, viij<sup>d</sup>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Here we have a decided instance of the variation in the number of
  acres represented by the carucate. I have generally found that the
  nearest approximation to correctness, where no other evidence is at hand,
  is to consider the carucate as designating about 100 acres.</p>

  <p class="author">L. B. L.</p>

  <p><i>Carucate of Land.</i>&mdash;A case in point is given in the 33rd
  vol. of the <i>Archæologia</i>, p. 271. The <!-- Page 76 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page76"></a>{76}</span>carucate frequently
  consisted of eight bovatæ of arable land; but the number of acres appears
  to have varied not only according to the quality of the soil, but
  according to the custom of husbandry of the shire: for where a two-years'
  course, or crop and fallow, was adopted, more land was adjudged to the
  carucate than where a three-years' course obtained, the land lying fallow
  not being reckoned or rateable. The object would appear to have been to
  obtain a carucate of equal value throughout the kingdom.</p>

  <p><i>Golden Frog and Sir John Poley</i> (Vol. i., p. 214. and
  372.).&mdash;Your correspondent <span class="sc">Gastros</span> suggests
  that "to the Low Countries, the land of frogs, we must turn for the
  solution of this enigma," (Vol. i., p. 372.); accordingly, it appears
  from the treatise of Bircherodius on the Knights of the Elephant, an
  order of knighthood in Denmark, conferred upon none but persons of the
  first quality and merit, that a frog is among the devices adopted by
  them; and we need not further seek for a reason why this <i>Symbolum
  Heroicum</i> was worn by Sir John Poley, who served much under Christian,
  king of Denmark (Vol. i., p. 214.), and distinguished himself much by his
  military achievements in the Low Countries (p. 372.).</p>

  <p><i>The Poley Frog.</i>&mdash;More than half a century ago, I was
  present when this singular appendage was the subject of conversation in a
  large literary party, but being then a schoolboy I made "no note of it."
  My recollection now is, that after some jokes on the name of Poley as
  that of a frog, allusion was made to an old court story of King James II.
  throwing a frog into the neck of William, third Earl of Pembroke. The
  story, with its consequences, may be found in the <i>Tixall Letters</i>,
  vol. i. p. 5.; Wood's <i>Athenæ Ox.</i>, vol. i. p. 546.; Park's <i>Royal
  and Noble Authors</i>, vol. ii. p. 249.</p>

  <p><i>Bands</i> (Vol. ii., p. 23.) are the descendants of the ruff a
  portion of the ordinary civil costume of the sixteenth century. In the
  reign of James I., the ruff was occasionally exchanged for a wide stiff
  collar, standing out horizontally and squarely, made of similar stuff,
  starched and wired, and sometimes edged like the ruff with lace. These
  collars were called bands. A good example occurs in the portrait of
  Shakspeare by Cornelius Jansen, engravings of which are well known. At
  the end of the seventeenth century these broad-falling bands were
  succeeded by the small Geneva bands, which have ever since been retained
  by our clergymen and councillors, but in a contracted form, having been
  originally <i>bonâ fide</i> collars, the ends of which hung negligently
  over the shoulders. (See Planché's <i>Brit. Costume</i>, pp. 350. 390.)
  Bands are worn by the ecclesiastics in France and Italy, as well as in
  England.</p>

  <p>In the second number of <i>Popular Tracts Illustrating the
  Prayer-Book</i>, p. 3., it is suggested that bands are perhaps the
  remains of the amice, one of the eucharistic vestments in use previous to
  the Reformation, which consisted of a square cloth, so put on that one
  side, which was embroidered, formed a collar round the neck, whilst the
  rest hung behind like a hood. By analogy with the scarf of our Protestant
  clergy, which is clearly the stole of the Roman Church retained under a
  different name, this suggestion is not without some degree of
  plausibility.</p>

  <p>The fact that the present academical costume is derived from the
  ordinary civil dress of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,
  sufficiently accounts for the retention of the bands as a part.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Arun.</span></p>

  <p>Surely bands are no part of the peculiar dress of the clergy, &amp;c.,
  but the ordinary dress of the people, retained by certain classes or
  professions, because they wished for something regular and distinctive.
  So the wigs of the judges were the fashionable dress 150 years ago. It is
  curious that the clergy have cut down their bands, while the lawyers
  still glory in comparatively large and flowing ones. Bands altered
  greatly in their form. Taylor, the Water Poet, I think, says&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The eighth Henry, as I understand,</p>
      <p>Was the first prince that ever wore a band,"</p>

  <p>or, indeed, person of any sort. The date of the same thing in France
  is mentioned in Vellay, but I forget it now.</p>

  <p><i>Bishops and their Precedence</i> (Vol. ii., p. 9.).&mdash;It may
  interest your correspondent E. to refer to a passage in Baker's
  <i>Chronicle</i>, sub anno 1461, p. 204., which would tend to show that
  the precedency of the spiritual barons was at that period disputed. That
  writer says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"John Earl of Oxford, with his son Aubrey de Vere, &amp;c., was
  convicted of treason and beheaded. John Earl of Oxford, in a former
  parliament, had disputed the question concerning the precedency of
  Temporal and Spiritual Barons, a bold attempt in those days, and by force
  of whose argument Judgment was given for the <i>Lords Temporal</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Where will this judgment or any account of the dispute be found?</p>

  <p class="author">G.</p>

  <p><i>"Imprest" and "Debenture"</i> (Vol. ii., p.
  40.).&mdash;<i>Imprest</i> is derived from the Italian <i>imprestare</i>,
  to lend, which is <i>im-præstare</i>, (Fr. <i>prêter</i>).
  <i>Debentur</i>, or <i>Debenture</i> (Lat. <i>debeo</i>), was originally
  a Customhouse term, meaning a certificate or ticket presented by an
  exporter, when a drawback or bounty was allowed on certain exported
  goods. Hence it seems <!-- Page 77 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page77"></a>{77}</span>to mean a certificate acknowledging a debt,
  and promising payment at a specified time on the presentation of the
  certificate. Debentures are thus issued by railway companies when they
  borrow money, and the certificates for annual interest which accompany
  them are, so to speak, <i>sub-debentures</i>. Perhaps this may throw
  <i>some</i> light upon the matter.</p>

  <p><i>Dutch Language</i> (Vol. i., p. 383.).&mdash;E. V. asks what are

  than Hendrik Conscience's novels, or Gerrits's <i>Zoon des Volks</i>. I
  would, however, advise him to get a volume of Jacob Cats' <i>Poems</i>,

  difficult to a beginner.</p>

  <p class="author">H. B. C.</p>

  <p><i>"Construe" and "Translate"</i> (Vol ii., p. 22.).&mdash;It is very
  common, I apprehend, in language, for two words, originally of the same
  meaning, or two spellings of the same word, to be gradually appropriated
  by usage to two subordinate uses, applications, and meanings of the word
  respectively, and that merely by accident, as to which of the two is
  taken for one of the subdivisions, and which for the other. We have made
  such an appropriation in our own time,&mdash;despatch and dispatch.</p>

  <p>It may be curious, however, to inquire how far back the distinction
  mentioned by your correspondent is found.</p>

  <p>"Construe," originally, must probably have meant, not to turn from one
  language into another, but to explain the construction, or what is called
  by the Greek name syntax, much like what in regard to a single word is
  called parsing.</p>

  <p><i>Dutton Family</i> (Vol. ii., p. 21.).&mdash;B. will find the
  <i>Dutton</i> proviso in the statute 17 Geo. II. explained by reference
  to Ormerod's <i>Cheshire</i>, vol. i. pp. 36. 477. 484.; Lyson's
  <i>Cheshire</i>; Blount's <i>Antient Tenures</i>, 298., &amp;c. An early
  grant by one of the Lacy family transferred to Hugh de Dutton and his
  heirs "magistratum omnium leccatorum et meritricum totius Cestriæ." In
  the fifteenth century the jurisdiction was claimed by the Dutton family,
  in respect of the lordship or manor of Dutton, and was then confined to a
  jurisdiction over the minstrels and musicians of the palatinate and city
  of Chester, who constituted, I presume, a department among the
  <i>leccatores</i>, or licorish fellows, mentioned above. In virtue of
  this jurisdiction the lord of Dutton had the advowry or "advocaria" of
  the minstrels of the district, and annually licensed them at a <i>Court
  of Minstrelsy</i>, where the homage consisted of a jury of sworn
  fiddlers; and certain dues, namely, flagons of wine and a lance or
  flagstaff, were yearly rendered to the lord. The last court was held in
  1756.</p>

  <p>As the early Vagrant Acts included "minstrels" in their definition of
  rogues and vagabonds, it is evident that the suitors of the Minstrelsy
  Court would have run the risk of commitment to the House of Correction
  and a whipping, if the acts had not specially excepted the franchise of
  the Dutton family from their operation. The earliest statutes are 14
  Eliz. c. 5.; 39 Eliz. c. 4.; and 43 Eliz. c. 9. Section 27. of the last
  Act clearly shows that it was the power of licensing minstrels which the
  proviso of the acts was intended to save. The pedigree of the Dutton
  family will be found in the volume of Ormerod already cited.</p>

  in Mr. Layard's <i>Nineveh and its Remains</i> (vol. ii. p. 374.) the
  following note:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The Scythians <i>scalped</i> and flayed their enemies, and used their
  skins as horse trappings."&mdash;<i>Herod.</i> iv. 64.</p>

  <p>Greenock.</p>

  <p><i>Scalping.</i>&mdash;Perhaps your correspondent T. J. (Vol. ii., p.
  12.) may recollect the allusion to "scalping," in Psalm lxviii. 21.; upon
  which verse an argument has been based in favour of the supposition, that
  the aborigines of America are derived from the ten tribes of Israel.</p>

  <p><i>Derivation of Penny</i> (Vol. i., pp. 384. 411.).&mdash;Akerman's
  <i>Numismatic Manual</i> (p. 228.) has, under the head of "Penny," the
  following remarks:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The penny is next in antiquity. It is first mentioned in the laws of
  Ina. The term has been derived by various writers from almost every
  European language; but the conjecture of Wachter, as noticed by Lye,
  seems the most reasonable. This writer derives it from the Celtic word
  <i>pen</i>, head; the heads of the Saxon princes being stamped on the
  earliest pennies. The fact of the <i>testoon</i> of later times having
  been so named, certainly adds weight to the opinion of Wachter."</p>

<h2>Miscellanies.</h2>

  <p>"<i>By Hook or by Crook</i>" (Vol. i., p. 405.).&mdash;The following
  extract may, perhaps, by multiplying instances, tend to corroborate the
  supposed origin of the above saying:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Not far from them [Peverell's Crosses], in the parish of Egloshayle,
  is another moonstone [granite] cross near Mount Charles, called the
  Prior's Cross, on which is cut the figure of a <i>hook</i> and a
  <i>crook</i>, in memory of the privilege granted by him to the poor of
  Bodmin, for gathering for fire-boot and house-boot such boughs and
  branches of such trees in his contiguous wood of Dunmere, as they could
  reach with a <i>hook and a crook</i> without further damage to the trees.
  From whence arose the Cornish proverb, <i>they will have it by hook or by
  crook</i>."&mdash;Hitchins and Drewe, <i>Hist. Cornwall</i>, p. 214. vol.

  <p><i>Burning dead Bodies.</i>&mdash;In his remarks on "ashes to ashes,"
  <span class="sc">Cinis</span> says (Vol. i., p.22.) that "the burning of
  the dead does not appear to be in itself an anti-christian ceremony,"
  &amp;c.: he is mistaken, for the early Christians, like the Jews, never
  burned their dead, but buried them. The catacombs of Rome and Naples,
  besides those in other places, were especially used for sepulture; and if
  <span class="sc">Cinis</span> wish for proofs, he will find an abundance
  in Rock's <i>Hierurgia</i>, t. ii. p. 802., &amp;c.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Cephas.</span></p>

  <p><i>Etymology of "Barbarian," &amp;c.</i>&mdash;Passow, in his Lexicon
  (ed. Liddell and Scott), s.v. <span title="barbaros" class="grk"
  >&beta;&#x1F71;&rho;&beta;&alpha;&rho;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, observes
  that the word was originally applied to "all that were not Greeks, or
  that did not speak Greek. It was used of all defects which the Greeks
  thought foreign to themselves and natural to other nations: but as the
  Hellenes and Barbarians were most of all <i>separated by language</i>,
  the word had always especial reference to this <span title="glôssa barbara" class="grk"
  >&gamma;&lambda;&#x1FF6;&sigma;&sigma;&alpha;
  &beta;&#x1F71;&rho;&beta;&alpha;&rho;&alpha;</span>, Soph. Aj. 1263,
  &amp;c." He considers the word as probably an onomatop&oelig;ion, to
  express the sound of a foreign tongue. (Cf. Gibbon, c. li.; Roth,
  <i>Ueber <!-- Page 79 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page79"></a>{79}</span>Sinn u. Gebrauch des Wortes Barbar.</i>
  Nürnberg, 1814.) I am disposed to look for the root in the Hebr. <span
  lang="he" title="BARAR" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D1;&#x5BC;&#x5B8;&#x5E8;&#x5B7;&#x5E8;</bdo></span>
  "<i>bâr&#x101;r</i>," <i>separavit</i>, in its Pilpel form, <span
  lang="he" title="BARBAR" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D1;&#x5B7;&#x5E8;&#x5B0;&#x5D1;&#x5B8;&#x5E8;</bdo></span>
  "<i>barbâr;</i>" hence, "one who is <i>separated</i>," "a foreigner." And
  even though Clel. Voc. 126., n., admits that <i>purus</i>, "clean,"
  "<i>separated</i> from dross," originally signifies cleansing by fire,
  <span title="pur" class="grk">&pi;&#x1FE6;&rho;</span>, yet both it and
  <i>far-farris</i>, "bread-corn," i. e. <i>separated</i> from the husk, and
  <i>fur-fur</i>, "bran," which is <i>separated</i> from the flour, may
  find their origin possibly from the same source.</p>

  <p><i>Royal and distinguished Disinterments.</i>&mdash;It is suggested
  that a volume of deep and general interest might be very easily formed by
  collecting and arranging the various notices that have from time to time
  appeared, of the disinterment of royal and distinguished personages. This
  hint seems deserving of the attention of Messrs. Nichols.</p>

  <p>The great interest excited by the further discovery in August last, of
  tesselated pavements at Cirencester induced Professor Buckman and Mr.
  Newmarch at once to issue proposals for a work, descriptive not only of
  those beautiful specimens of Roman art, but also of all such other of the
  numerous remains found in the same locality as they could satisfactorily
  identify. The result was, such a well-filled Subscription List, and such
  ready co-operation on the part of those who had collectetd and preserved
  such objects, as have enabled these Gentlemen to produce, under the title
  of <i>Illustrations of the Remains of Roman Art in Cirencester, the Site
  of Ancient Corinium</i>, a work which will not only gratify the antiquary
  by its details, and the beauty and fidelity of its engravings, but enable
  the general reader, without any great exercise of imagination, to picture
  to himself the social condition of Corinium when garrisoned by Roman
  cohorts,</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
